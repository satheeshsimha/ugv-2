I've run across a `}' that doesn't seem to match anything.
For example, `\def\a#1{...}' and `\a}' would produce
this error. If you simply proceed now, the `\par' that
I've just inserted will cause me to report a runaway
argument that might be the root of the problem. But if
your `}' was spurious, just type `2' and it will go away.

Runaway argument?
latin1\ifx \@empty \@empty \else \expandafter \zap@space \fi \@empty 
! Paragraph ended before \@fileswith@pti@ns was complete.

I suspect you've forgotten a `}', causing me to apply this
control sequence to too much text. How can we recover?
My plan is to forget the whole thing and hope for the best.

! TeX capacity exceeded, sorry [input stack size=5000].

If you really absolutely need more capacity,
you can ask a wizard to enlarge me.
